dockermix
============

A quick and simple tool to start/destroy multiple docker containers based on a simple YAML specification.

Dependencies
=============

- Docker: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker
- docker-py: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-py
- Python pip package manager

Installation
============

Install Docker as described here: http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/

Then:
    sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
    git clone https://github.com/kstaken/dockermix.git
    cd dockermix
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    python setup.py install

Configuration File Format
=========================

YAML format basically maps to the docker-py api. Here's an example yaml file:

Note: the syntax for volumes is not fully specified and bind mounts are not currently supported.

    containers:
      test_server_1: 
        base_image: ubuntu
        ports: 
          - '8080' 
        command: 'ps aux' 
        hostname: test_server_1 
        user: root
        detach: true
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        mem_limit: 2560000
        environment: 
          - ENV_VAR=testing
        dns: 
          - 8.8.8.8
          - 8.8.4.4
        volumes: 
          /var/testing: {}
              
      test_server_2: 
        base_image: ubuntu
        command: 'ls -l'
        hostname: test_server_2

Command Line Tools
===

Initial enironments are defined in `dockermix.yml`. If there is a `dockermix.yml` in the current directory it will be automatically used otherwise the `-f` option can be used to specify the location of the file.

The environment state will be saved to a file named `environment.yml` and commands that manipulate existing environments will look for an `environment.yml` in the current directory or it can be specified by the `-e` option.

dockermix build
----

Setup a new environment using a `dockermix.yml` specification.

dockermix start
----

Start an existing environment that had been previously stopped and save in `environment.yml`

dockermix stop
----

Stop all containers in an environment and save the state to `environment.yml`


dockermix destroy
----

Destroy all containers defined in an environment. Once destroyed the containers can not be recoved.

dockermix status
----

Show the status of the containers in an environment.

Roadmap
====

- Add the ability to share configuration data between containers
- Explicitly specify startup order and dependencies
- More powerful Docker Builder support (currently docker-py reimplements Docker Builder and it out of sync with the server implementation)
- ...
